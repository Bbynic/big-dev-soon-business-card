## Requirements
- [ ] Create a full-page background with a centered card layout.
- [ ] Add a user contact section on the left of the card with email, phone, and clickable social icons.
- [ ] Add a user image in the center of the card.
- [ ] Add a user info section with the name on the right of the card, position, location, description, and technologies.
- [ ] Implement absolute-positioned shapes to improve the layout.
- [ ] Enhance user experience with animations, such as image-loading skeleton animation or fade-in effects.

## Deployment
Once you are ready with the project and unlocked the Complete step, you can try deploying the project to Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages. One important thing to remember is that we've added a `<bds />` tag to the `index.html` file and will do a check against it while trying to add a Project URL. Don't forget it! ðŸ˜Š
