# Business Card Project

Hello to [BigDevSoon](https://bigdevsoon.me/) ðŸ‘‹. 

Build a beautiful website that showcases your skills and personality as a developer. Challenge yourself to stand out and impress potential employers or clients.

## Prerequisites
- Start this project in our [App](https://app.bigdevsoon.me/) before you dive in. ðŸ‘€
- Choose the technologies, tools, and libraries that best suit your taste and have fun building this project. ðŸ˜Š
- Have a strong desire to learn and improve your skills as a Big Developer. ðŸš€

## Requirements
- [ ] The website looks similar to the design and is implemented as a Desktop version only.
- [ ] Icons should be clickable with a hover effect and redirect users to external pages in a new tab.
- [ ] Users can hover over and click on the email and it'll have the proper `mailto` link.
- [ ] Users can hover over and click on the phone and it'll have the proper `tel` link.
- [ ] Add animations, we recommend a Fade In when the website is loaded and a skeleton animation for loading the user's image.

## Deployment
Once you are ready with the project and unlocked the Complete step, you can try deploying the project to Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages. One important thing to remember is that we've added a `<bds />` tag to the `index.html` file and will do a check against it while trying to add a Project URL. Don't forget it! ðŸ˜Š
