# Business Card Project
Hello to [BigDevSoon](https://bigdevsoon.me/) ðŸ‘‹

Build a beautiful website that showcases your skills and personality as a developer. Challenge yourself to stand out and impress potential employers or clients.

## How to start
1. Start the project in our [App](https://app.bigdevsoon.me/) to get a feel for it. 
2. Review the requirements listed below in this README.
3. Go through the design images on the [project's page](https://app.bigdevsoon.me/projects/business-card) and import the `.fig` file into Figma to understand the layout and design elements.
4. Clone this repository or use [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) to set up the project environment.
5. Choose your preferred technology stack and overwrite repository files as needed to set up your project structure. We included a few files and the `assets` folder for convenience, extracted from the design.
6. Begin coding, either using the Freerun mode to work on each card individually or the Speedrun mode to work at your own pace. Be sure to follow the guidelines outlined below.
7. Have a strong desire to learn and improve your skills as a Big Developer. ðŸš€


## Requirements
- [ ] Create a full-page background with a centered card layout.
- [ ] Add a user contact section on the left of the card with email, phone, and clickable social icons.
- [ ] Add a user image in the center of the card.
- [ ] Add a user info section with the name on the right of the card, position, location, description, and technologies.
- [ ] Implement absolute-positioned shapes to improve the layout.
- [ ] Enhance user experience with animations, such as image-loading skeleton animation or fade-in effects.

## Deployment
Once you are ready with the project and unlocked the Complete step, you can try deploying the project to Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages. One important thing to remember is that we've added a `<bds />` tag to the `index.html` file and will do a check against it while trying to add a Project URL. Don't forget it! ðŸ˜Š
